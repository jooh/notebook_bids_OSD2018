# bids demo
[RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) slideshow notebook for
[BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) presentation at 2018 CBU Open Science Day.

# install requirements

You will need jupyter, [Johan's fork of dcm2bids](https://github.com/jooh/Dcm2Bids),
dcm2niix, datalad, and maybe some additional dependencies. The slideshow was developed
using the [CBU nipy conda environment](https://github.com/MRC-CBU/cbu_nipy_env), so
installing that may be an easy way to get up and running.

At CBU, `conda activate cbu_nipy_201811` should do the job.
