# BIDS demo
[RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) slideshow notebook for
[BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) presentation at 2018 CBU Open Science Day.

This notebook first introduces BIDS, including basic interfacing with BIDS data using pybids. The second half of the presentation is an interactive tutorial of dcm2bids, a tool for converting MRI DICOM data to the BIDS format.

# install requirements

With conda python, it's easy - see environment.yml. You will also need to activate some notebook extensions (see postBuild).

At CBU, `conda activate cbu_nipy_1_00` should work.
